1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React is a library that lets us create UI and attempts to solve the problem of separation of concerns. Some concepts that help demonstrate this are how we are able to program in a declarative manner or how we can use JSX, syntatical sugar that gives us the feeling of writing in HTML right next to our JavaScript.

1. What does it mean to think in react?

I'm still struggling to articulate this but the best I come up with is to think in terms of breaking things out in reusable pieces and thinking more about what we want to do than how to do it.

1. Describe state.

State is what the data looks like at a given time.

1. Describe props.

Props are properties of an element that we are able to pass to other components to use.

1. What are side effects, and how do you sync effects in a React component to state or prop changes?

Side affects are any changes that occur outside the body of our function. We use useEffect to manage this.
