1. What is React JS and what problems does it try and solve? Support your answer with concepts introduced in class and from your personal research on the web.

React is a library that lets us create UI and attempts to solve the problem of separation of concerns. Some concepts that help demonstrate this are how we are able to program in a declarative manner or how we can use JSX, syntatical sugar that gives us the feeling of writing in HTML right next to our JavaScript. It reminds me of .NET development honestly via ASP
